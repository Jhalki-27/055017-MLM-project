        "\n",
        "## **Observations**\n",
        "1. **Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrogram)**:\n",
        "   - The dendrogram suggests the presence of clear hierarchical structures in the dataset.\n",
        "   - The vertical lines represent the distances (or dissimilarities) between clusters.\n",
        "   - Significant vertical gaps in the dendrogram indicate potential cluster separations.\n",
        "   - A threshold can be chosen (e.g., cutting the dendrogram at a specific height) to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Silhouette Scores**:\n",
        "   - The silhouette scores decrease as the number of clusters increases, indicating a diminishing cluster compactness and separation.\n",
        "   - A high silhouette score for 2 clusters suggests that the dataset is well-separated into two distinct groups.\n",
        "   - Adding more clusters reduces the score, which might imply over-segmentation or less meaningful divisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Findings**\n",
        "1. **Optimal Clustering**:\n",
        "   - From the silhouette plot, **2 clusters** appear to provide the best balance between cluster separation and compactness. However, the dendrogram offers a hierarchical perspective that may suggest a different cluster count based on the desired granularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Cluster Characteristics**:\n",
        "   - The clustering process has identified groups of similar data points in the dataset, which can correspond to patterns, behaviors, or anomalies.\n",
        "   - Specific clusters may represent different product categories, market segments, or trade types depending on the dataset's context.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Trade-off Between Simplicity and Detail**:\n",
        "   - While fewer clusters (e.g., 2) are simpler and more interpretable, higher cluster counts (e.g., 3–5) provide finer segmentation that may be valuable for specific use cases like targeted marketing or anomaly detection."

        "\n",
        "1. **Presence of Two Distinct Groups**:  \n",
        "   - The silhouette score analysis reveals that the dataset can be optimally divided into **two distinct groups or clusters**. This indicates that the data points within each group share significant similarities, while the groups themselves are well-separated.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Strategic Implications of the Two Groups**:  \n",
        "   - These two groups may represent key segments such as:\n",
        "     - **Product Categories**: Two broad product types dominating import/export transactions.\n",
        "     - **Market Segments**: Distinct buyer or supplier groups with varying trade behaviors.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Simplified Segmentation**:  \n",
        "   - Keeping two clusters allows for a high-level segmentation, making it easier to develop targeted strategies without overcomplicating the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Actionable Strategies**:\n",
        "   - Focus on **tailored marketing strategies** for each group to maximize trade efficiency.\n",
        "   - Design **customized supply chain processes** for each group to optimize resource allocation and logistics.\n",
        "   - Investigate outliers within each group to identify unique opportunities or potential risks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Validation of Cluster Use**:  \n",
